## Unit 2 (KP) -- Traveling Salesman Problem

Weeks 8 and 9

- MILP Formulations for the Traveling Salesman Problem
- Cutting planes for the TSP
- Practice on the TSP

As a possible preparation for this class, I may suggest to revise the classical maximum flow and the minimum cut problems. 
This can be reviewed in, e.g., a classical textbook of Hillier F., Lieberman G. - Introduction to Operations Research, available here
