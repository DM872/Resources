    "# Task 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution proposed here is partly taken from Gurobi [Feature Selection\n",
    "case](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/linear_regression/l0_regression.ipynb)\n",
    "to which you are referred for a more thorough machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets and Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "$i \\in I=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$: Set of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$j \\in J=\\{0,1,2,\\dots,p\\}$: Set of features, where the first ID corresponds to the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ell \\in L = J \\setminus \\{0\\}$: Set of features, where the intercept is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "$s \\in \\mathbb{N}$: Number of features to include in the model, ignoring the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$: Weight of feature $j$, representing the change in the response variable per unit-change of feature $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$z_\\ell \\in \\{0,1\\}$: 1 if weight of feature $\\ell$ is exactly equal to zero, and 0 otherwise. Auxiliary variable used to manage the budget constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training error**: Minimize the Sum of Absolute Residuals (aka L1) more robust with respect to outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{Min} \\quad Z = \\sum_{i \\in I}\\left|y_i-\\sum_{j \\in J}\\beta_{j}x_{ij}\\right|\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "or minimize the Sum of Squares of Residuals (RSS) (aka L2):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{Min} \\quad Z = \\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(y_i-\\sum_{j \\in\n",
    "J}\\beta_{j}x_{ij}\\right)^2 = \\beta^T X^T X\\beta- 2y^TX\\beta+y^T y\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Lasso approach we add the Lasso term in the objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{Min} \\quad Z + \\lambda \\sum_{\\ell=1}^p\\left|\\beta_\\ell\\right|\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso term could also be expressed with L2: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{Min} \\quad Z + \\lambda \\sum_{\\ell=1}^p\\left(\\beta_\\ell\\right)^2\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, advances in mixed integer linear programming allow us to model\n",
    "the feature selection by means of binary variables $z_\\ell$ and constraints on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutual exclusivity\n",
    "\n",
    "For each feature $\\ell$, if $z_\\ell=1$, then $\\left|\\beta_\\ell\\right|=0$ (in the\n",
    "solution by Gurobi this is called the $L_0$-norm)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\left|\\beta_\\ell\\right|\\leq M (1-z_\\ell)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the big-M is the upper bound of the $\\beta$ variables, which are actually\n",
    "unlimited. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can express each of these $L$ constraints as a Special Ordered Set of type 1,\n",
    "meaning that at most one variables is different from zero (variables can be both\n",
    "integer or continuous in SOS-1):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(\\beta_\\ell, z_\\ell): \\text{SOS-1} \\quad \\forall \\ell \\in L\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Budget constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly $|L| - s$ feature weights must be equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{\\ell \\in L}z_\\ell = |L| - s\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This model, by means of constraint 2, implicitly considers all ${{p} \\choose s}$ feature subsets at once. However, we also need to find the value for $s$ that maximizes the performance of the regression on unseen observations. Notice that the training error decreases monotonically as more features are considered, so it is not advisable to use it as the performance metric. Instead, we should estimate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) via cross-validation. This metric is defined as $\\text{MSE}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}$, where $y_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$ are the observed and predicted values for the ith observation, respectively. Then, we will fine-tune $s$ using grid search, provided that the set of possible values is quite small.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearization\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 terms can be linearized as follows (see slides for another possible way of\n",
    "linearizing absolute values).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function $\\min Z= \\sum_{i \\in I}\\left|y_i-\\sum_{j \\in\n",
    "J}\\beta_{j}x_{ij}\\right|$ becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\min &\\sum_{i \\in I} \\epsilon_i^+ +\\epsilon_i^-\\\\\n",
    " &y_i-\\sum_{j \\in J}\\beta_{j}x_{ij} = \\epsilon_i^+ -\\epsilon_i^-\\\\\n",
    " &\\epsilon_i^+, \\epsilon_i^- \\geq 0\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "and the constraints $\\left|\\beta_\\ell\\right|\\leq M (1-z_\\ell)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\min &\\sum_{i \\in I} \\beta_\\ell^+ +\\beta_\\ell^- \\leq M(1-z_\\ell)\\\\\n",
    " &\\beta_{\\ell} = \\beta_\\ell^+ -\\beta_\\ell^-\\\\\n",
